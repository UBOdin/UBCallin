The PiTFT has four buttons, and the Pi Phone software is set up to let you talk to them.  Have your program listen for and react to the following four broadcasts: 
* **button-1-pushed** (for the Button labeled #27)
* **button-2-pushed** (for the Button labeled #23)
* **button-3-pushed** (for the Button labeled #22)
* **button-4-pushed** (for the Button labeled #17)

What kind of cool things can you do?
